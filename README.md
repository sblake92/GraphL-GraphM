# GraphL-GraphM
The specifications for this program were determined by the University of Washington. The implementation was executed by myself, except for the NodeData ADT, and the driver file, lab3.cpp, which were provided by the University. This program constructs two different graphs: a matrix (M), and a linked list (L). The matrix uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest weighted path, while the list uses a depth-first search algorithm on an unweighted graph.
